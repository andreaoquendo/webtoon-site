# Webtoon Site Remaking
  
<p> Trying to write webtoon's site. The original site is: <a href="https://www.webtoons.com/en/">Webtoon (EN)</a>.

<p>It has already:
<ul>
  <li>a header bar
  <li>research history (using browser's localStorage)
</ul>

<p>Added:
  <ul>
    <li>Week-day bar that updates with clicks and with date
    <li>Started to do little pages.
  </ul>
